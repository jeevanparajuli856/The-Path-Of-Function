    show solution first with dissolve
    a "Let's start with the first box. It's for the function declaration, which calculates the area of a rectangle."
    a "We can confirm this from the print() statement inside the main() block."
    show solution first option with dissolve
    a "There are two options for the function definition, but we'll pick the first box: def calculate_area(length, width)."
    a "The second option only uses width, but to calculate the area, we need both length and width."
    show solution second with dissolve
    a "Next is the second box. This box contains the core logic of the function: multiplying length and width and storing the result in the variable area."
    show solution second option with dissolve
    a "Since the function clearly returns area, the correct option for this box is area = length * width."

    show solution third with dissolve
    a "Now, let's move to the main() function. The first box in the main() block is for variable declaration."
    show solution third point with dissolve
    a "Since we're calculating the area of a rectangle, we need to declare a variable for length."
    show solution third option with dissolve
    a "At this point, the correct answer could be length = 10 or len = 10, but let's solve the next box to confirm."

    show solution fourth with dissolve # put?? in third block
    a "Box 4 is for calling the calculate_area() function and assigning its result to the area variable, which is printed afterward."
    show solution fourth option with dissolve
    a "The correct option for this box is area = calculate_area(length, width), since the other option only passes width, which isn't valid."

    show solution third fourth with dissolve
    a "Now let's go back to Box 3. Since length is used as a parameter in the function call in Box 4, we can confidently say the correct answer for Box 3 is `length = 10`"

    show solution fifth with dissolve
    a "Finally, the last box remains. We've completed the main() block, but to execute the program, we need to call main()."
    show solution fifth option with dissolve
    a "The correct answer for the last box is main()."
